"""
Create a class called DiceBag.

In the initialization method (__init__), it should accept the number of sides
desired and the number of dice avaialble to roll and set those as attributes.

For example, we can have a bag of 10 six-sided dice.

Add 3 methods:
    - A method that allows you to remove up to as many dice as there are in the bag.
      If more are removed the program does not allow it and gives a message

    - A method to roll up to as many dice as there are in the bag and return the results of each.
      Again, if more are rolled the program does not allow it and gives a message

    - A method to add dice to the bag

###Some possible methods for testing (Don't have to use)
if __name__ == '__main__':
    # bag = DiceBag(6,10)
    # bag.add_dice(3)
    # print(bag.number)
    #
    # roll = bag.roll(4)
    # print(roll)
