Exercise 1 - Capital indexes

Write a function named capital_indexes. The function takes a single parameter, which is a string. 
Your function should return a list of all the indexes in the string that have capital letters.
For example, calling capital_indexes("HeLlO") should return the list [0, 2, 4].

Exercise 2 - Prime Checker

Write a function that excepts a positive integer greater then 1 as an input and returns if that number is prime or not.

You should also include a validity checker somewhere in your program to check that the input is valid 
(a positive integer greater then one is entered))
